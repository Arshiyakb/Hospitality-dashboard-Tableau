Problem Statement:

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Task:

1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2. 
3. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
4. 
5. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

Overall insight:

•	Total revenue – 1,708.77M, occupancy – 57.9%, Total Bookings -134.6K, Average Ratings-3.6, cancellation rate- 24.8 %

•	Highest revenue received from City Mumbai-668.64M, average ratings -delhi 3.8, more revenue during weekend, best booking platform make my trip, Luxury category has more revenue around 62 %, top hotel Atliq Exotica, Elite room class is best class.

•	Even though Delhi has good rating generate low income, more concentration should be given to Delhi Hotel, by converting other room category to RT2, which is preferred by most customers. 

•	More collaboration should be done with online platform compared to direct offline to attract more customers.
